                            <p>
I am a finance and business information systems double major, a horn frog, and a tennis player. Over the past few years, I've been working hard to discover what I truly love. I've considered all sorts of different majors from Biology to Computer Science, and now to Finance and Business Information Systems.</p> <p>As early as I can remember, I've helped my family financially. No, not by working at 8 year old, but by making sure bills were paid on time, calling AT&T to lower our monthly phone bill costs, and translating to make sure my parents understand what I'm doing. Now that I've finally started taking Business classes, I can proudly say that I have found my passion.

                                    <p>So it’s day one of blogging… and I have no idea where to start. So I’ve decided to just state a purpose and go from there. By starting this blog, I’m hoping that I knock out quite a few birds with one stone. I’ll mainly be talking about things I’ve learned in Business school, but this first post will tell me more about me. And the person I am. Continue reading if this interests you. Some reasons that I, personally, will be starting a blog are: </p>
                                <p><b>1. Being about to express myself</b></p>

                                <p>I’ve been constantly recommended to start a blog solely for this. My peers have been nagging me to start a blog so that they could get to know me better. I refer to my “peers” as people that have been referred to me by my close friends. Don’t know if that made sense, but we’ll roll with it. My close friends know me extremely well, and say that they love me for who I am, and love my story and everything about me. To this day, I’m not sure if it’s because we’re friends that they say that, or if they actually mean it. Anyways, I’ve constantly had trouble opening up to new people, and have been told that once someone gets to know me, they fall in love with me…just kidding, they fall in love with my personality. Anyways, let’s get back on topic.</p>


                                <p><b>2. Distinguishing myself</b></p>
                                <p>Another reason why I’m starting a blog is because of this. I’m a Business major at Texas Christian University, and have gotten recommendations to start a blog because of this. Everyone wants to start a blog, but no one ever gets around to doing it. Is it the money? No, it isn’t. 4$ a month? That’s not bad at all. Is it the time commitment? Possibly. I don’t feel that it’s a huge time commitment at all. I estimate that 30 minutes will be taken out to write this, depending on how much I decide to ramble on. </p>

                                <p>Anyways, I hope that possible employers will see my website and think “Gee, we should hire this guy just because of this!” In reality, this would never happen. I pray every day that it does, but it won’t. Gotta keep believin’. If this website gives me any competitive edge at all in the hiring process, it’s done its job. </p>

                                <p><b>3. Mapping out goals </b></p>
                                <p>This blog should keep me on track with life. I feel like I have quite an interesting life, and I love talking about it. Everyone loves talking about their life. I’m just not sure how well I can type it up, so this helps in that as well. Why did that not get another bullet point? Because I’m getting to the point of laziness. Anyways, if something interesting happens to me, I’ll blog about it. If I promise something, I’ll make sure I won’t do it very often, I hope that when I look back at this, it’ll point me in the right direction again. In the future, I hope I can have people that read this blog to keep me on track. Greedy right? Sorry</p>

                                <p><b>Ending Notes </b></p>
                                <p>I feel much more confident about writing already. If you somehow made it to the end of this, I’d like to applaud you first, and then thank you. You somehow made it through walls of text about a random guy talking about his life. Well done. Anyways, please, please, please give me any suggestions you have on improving this thing. If you couldn’t already tell, I’m kinda new at this. Ciao!</p>
